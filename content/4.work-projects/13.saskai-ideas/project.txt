I designed and implemented a public blog for Sasaki Associated - an architecture and planning firm near Boston.  Over the course of one month I:
- did a mini-anthropology of their internal culture
- mocked up example designs
- interviewed and identified potential contributors
- implemented a chosen design in Drupal
- created a multi-tiered plan to keep content flowing in
- launched the site and did basic SEO to bring Sasaki's ideas to a new audience

This project integrated many of the lessons in my brother's book - <a href="http://www.personalitynotincluded.com/">Personality Not Included</a>.
