With colleagues at the <a href="http://civic.mit.edu/">MIT Center for Civic Media</a>, 
I created an example website that tracks reading grade levels in the media.   This is a toy project to test our infrastructure for quantitative news analysis.  The simple website let you compare the distribution of what levels various media levels operate at.
