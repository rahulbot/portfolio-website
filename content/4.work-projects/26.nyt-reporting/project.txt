<p>
With colleagues at the <a href="http://civic.mit.edu/">MIT Center for Civic Media</a>, I did a deep dive into the archives of the New York Times (via their <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2008T19">annotated corpus</a>).  One of the results was a poster detailing the domestic vs. international coverage over the last 20 years.
