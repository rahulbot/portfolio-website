I worked with the Department of Education in Curituba Brazil to conduct workshops with teachers about integrating the LEGO robotics system into their curriculum.  My first visit was part of a large gathering organized by the MIT Media Lab.  I returned for a smaller training seminar.  During both visits I worked with teachers and students from around the city to introduce the technology, combine it with local materials, and facilitate discussions about robotics as an education tool.
