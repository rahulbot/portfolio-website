In collaboration with Dalia Othman (Berkman Center) and Catherine Dâ€™Ignazio (Emerson College Dept of Journalism & Engagement Lab) I organized a study group on Data Storytelling for Civic Impact.  The study group was hosted by the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society.

The goal of this study group is to build a network of educators and practitioners that can develop shared educational approaches on issues surrounding BUILDING CAPACITY and data literacy, the ETHICS of data and the CIVIC IMPACT of data-driven storytelling and how to measure it.
