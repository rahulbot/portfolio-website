I was the programmer on a small team developing the Forum Network for WGBH (a Boston PBS station).  I managed integration with the video CDN and created custom Drupal modules and scripts.  I delivered tested, well documented PHP code the client as part of handoff process.  The website later launched with a redesign - I'm not sure if it still includes any of my code.
