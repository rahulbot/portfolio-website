<p>
The Conservation Lab table is an interactive, multitouch table created by <a href="http://www.tactable.com/">Tactable</a> for the <a href="http://www.mfa.org/americas-wing/">new Art of the Americas wing of the Boston MFA</a>.  The installation allows users to explore the issues that go into deciding whether to restore an aging piece of art.  I created the user interface software for the installation.
