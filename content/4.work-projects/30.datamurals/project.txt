I have been collaborating with my wife Emily to help groups turn their data stories into community murals.  We facilitate groups finding a story in their data that they want to tell, collaboratively creating a visual that tells that story, and then painting it as a mural!  Our goals are to both build their capacity to creatively tell their data stories, and to help them do their work more effectively.
