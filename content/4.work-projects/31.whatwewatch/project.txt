With Ed Platt and Ethan Zuckerman here at the MIT Center for Civic Media, I built an online tool geographically explore trending videos on YouTube. We logged daily information on trending videos from YouTube and built a network of countries that watch the same videos.  We're doing a bunch of analysis around this to look at cultural connectivity via videos.
