Brazilnut played a reportoire of brazilian music, from bossa to funk.  I played percussion in this band with a number of friends of mine over about 4 years.  We gig'ed consistently at <a href="http://www.rylesjazz.com/">Ryles Jazz Club</a>.  It was a great chance for me to learn and hone my skills as a percussionist on some challenging and diverse material, with an amazing group of people.
