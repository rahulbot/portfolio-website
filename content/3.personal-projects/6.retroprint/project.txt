I adapted my iDisplay code to produce a receipt printer connected to the internet.  Why is this useful?  Well, often I have some short bit of text on my computer that I need with my when I run out of the house.  I can never find a pencil to write it down, so now I can just paste it into a webpage, hit print, and it comes out on my receipt printer!

This is the first really interesting thing to come out of my explorations with a receipt printer I bought on Ebay.  Originally the PCB I designed ran it's own server, but then I changed it to talk to a web-based server.
