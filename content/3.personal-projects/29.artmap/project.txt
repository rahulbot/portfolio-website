My wife Emily received a grant from the <a href="http://somervilleartscouncil.org">Somerville Arts Council</a> to build an online public map of Somerville, MA, USA.  You can <a href="http://www.somervilleartscouncil.org/artmap">browse and submit pieces of art on their website</a>.
</p>
<p>
To support some outreach activities, I built a website that lets you print maps for each neighborhood in our town. Check it out at <a href="http://somervilleartmap.org">http://somervilleartmap.org</a>.
