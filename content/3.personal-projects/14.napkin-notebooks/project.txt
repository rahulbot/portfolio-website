After many a brainstorming session with back-of-envelope calculations and napkin-sketches, I decided it would be fun to professionalize some of the objects.  The first result were napkin notebooks, bound and covered sets of napkins from common fast food stores.  I think they help get the creative juices flowing.

A friend alerted me to the fact that someone produced and sold something similar to this: <a href="http://gizmodo.com/325182/napkin-notebook-an-idea-so-good-it-must-have-been-written-on-a-napkin">www.napkinnotebooks.com</a>.  So you can buy some for yourself!
