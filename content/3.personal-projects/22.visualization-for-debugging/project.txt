I wrote a guest post about visualization for debugging.  This often-overlooked use of visualization is about creating and playing with pictures of data to reveal patterns or bugs in the code you are writing or system you are using.  I give a few examples and some reminders about quick-and-dirty techniques that can yield useful results without too much work.

The post comes out of and refers to work I did at nTAG interactive, where we developed and deployed  interactive nametags that communicated over a custom wireless network.
