PalmPaint is my open-source paint program for color Palm Pilots. No, it doesn't have robots or monkeys, but you can draw yourself some with it! Some of the features:
- A saveable swatch of colors (double-tap to edit)
- Erase (double-tap to erase full screen)
- Copy and paste (option of white being transparent)
- Undo (one-level)
- Eye-dropper to select colors off the screen
- Resizeable pen (click on up and down arrows), always a circle
- File management (open, save, and delete)
- Wicked cool interface (with graffitti shortcuts for all menu commands)
- Tons of commenting (it's open-source, so I felt the need)
