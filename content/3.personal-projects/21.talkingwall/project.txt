The TalkingWall is a real time visualization of Twitter posts created for the launch of my brother's <a href="http://www.personalitynotincluded.com/">Personality Not Included</a> book. Messages from Twitter users online during the party flew onto the projected visualization on two walls of the space. This project was an attempt to successfully integrated the pre-existing online community into the local space of the party to create buzz about the book.
