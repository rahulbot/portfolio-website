I have co-facilitated a few workshops for community coalition members on how to present data to their community, funders, and other audiences.  My primary focus has been on how to structure a data-driven argument that balances quantitative and qualitative data sources. These workshops were hosted at the <a href="http://www.healthier-communities.org/">Metrowest Regional Center for Healthy Communities</a>.
