ASCII Font Inspector is just a small application for looking closer at a font. When you select a font, it displays all the standard Roman characters in a table. You can click each of the letters to see a bigger version of it on the left. You can save the character to a JPG, or export it to ASCII-art. As the name suggests, this only supports ascii characters (because that is all I needed to work with).
