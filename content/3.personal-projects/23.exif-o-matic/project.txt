Most digital cameras store loads of meta-data within the image files that they create, these data make up the EXIF standard. They include things like the exact time the photo was taken, the f-stop, the flash setting, etc. I wanted to view this information as part of my online photo album, but I couldn't find an EXIF library that exported to TXT and HTML, so I wrote a small application around someone else's raw extraction library. I guessed that it would only take me a day or so to clean it up to a releasable point, so I went ahead and did it.

<h4>How Do I Use It?</h4>
<p>
<i>Windows users, you'll want to double-click the "EXIF-O-Matic.bat" file. If a window appears and then vanishes, you might need to download the latest version of Java.</i> All users should keep an eye on the status bar at the bottom of the window, it gives instructions and feedback about what is going on. <a href="/collateral/EOM-example.html">Click for an example of the HTML that it outputs</a>. It is pretty simple to use:
- Choose File->Open to load an image and view it's EXIF tags
- Click the "Export File" button to save a text or html version of the tags
- Click the "Process Folder" button to export the tags of all the images in the same folder

<h4>Download v1.2</h4>

<b><i>Sorry, but I no longer support this software.  In fact, I haven't really touched it in years (beyond making sure it still runs on new computers).  I continue to post it here because lots of people apparently still find it useful.</i></b>

I've released this postcard-ware... meaning if you like it then I ask you to send me a postcard!  However, a number of folks  have asked if they can chip in to futher its development.  With that in mind, I've added this button to let you send me some money.  Thanks!
