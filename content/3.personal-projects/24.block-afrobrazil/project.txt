I recently joined the Bloco AfroBrazil percussion group.  We are a diverse troop of drummers playing music from the Bahia part of Brazil.  Berklee-trained musician Marcus Santos composes for and leads the group.  We play raucous gigs in and around the Boston area all year long, so come and check us out!

They recently released a CD (before I joined).  You can <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=295159336&s=143441">buy it on iTunes</a> or <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/marcussantos">buy it on cdbaby</a>.
