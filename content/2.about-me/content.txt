<b>My name is Rahul Bhargava</b>
I like building things.
I work on technology and work with people.
I work at the <a href="http://civic.mit.edu/">MIT Center for Civic Media</a>.
I live in Somerville, MA - just outside of Boston in the United States.
This website serves as a simple portfolio of things I work on, and things I build.
